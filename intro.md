# Lecture notes in OR/MS with Python

Welcome to a short introductory material on Operation Research and Management Science using Python!

Operations Research, (a.k.a., Management Science) is an interdisciplinary field that uses analytical methods for quantitative decision-making. The emphasis of Operations Research is on practical applications, and as such, it has substantial overlap with many other disciplines, like industrial engineering and business management. It uses tools from mathematical sciences, such as modeling, probability, statistics, and optimization, to arrive at optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex decision-making problems. Operations Research is often concerned with determining the extreme values of real-world objectives, such as maximizing profit or minimizing cost.

<!---
Operations Research is used to deal with real-world problems. For example:

* Scheduling: buses, planes, sporting events, hospital patients, classes.
* Product development: pricing, sales forecasts.
* Inventory: how many items to hold in stock, when to replenish.
* Organizations: business management, business development.
* Queueing: waiting for lines at amusement parks, banks, movie theaters, the line at the store to buy new electronic gadgets, traffic.
* Environment: managing sustainable resources, reducing materials needed to manufacture a product.
* Optimizing: internet search engines, product design.
* Marketing: store layout, advertising, social media, online ad placement, recommendations on a website.
* Decision making: security, investment, what college to attend.
