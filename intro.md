# Lecture notes in OR with Python

Welcome to our short introductory course on Operation Research and Management Science using Python!

Operations research (OR), (a.k.a., Management Science) is an interdisciplinary field that uses analytical methods for quantitative decision-making. The emphasis of OR is on practical applications, and as such, it has substantial overlap with many other disciplines, like industrial engineering and business management. It uses tools from mathematical sciences, such as modeling, statistics, and optimization, to arrive at optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex decision-making problems. Operations research is often concerned with determining the extreme values of real-world objectives, such as maximizing profit or minimizing cost.

Operations research is used to deal with real-world problems. For example:

* Scheduling: hospital patients, classes, buses, planes, sporting events.
* Marketing: store layout, advertising, social media, online ad placement, recommendations on a website.
* Product development: product features, pricing, sales forecasts.
* Inventory: how many to build, how many touchpads the store should have in stock.
* Organizations: business management, cross-cultural issues, social networks.
* Queueing: waiting for lines at amusement parks, banks, movie theaters, the line at the store to buy new electronic gadgets, traffic.
* Environment: managing sustainable resources, reducing materials needed to manufacture a product.
* Optimizing: internet search engines, product design.
* Decision making: security, investment, what college to attend.
