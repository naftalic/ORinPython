Lecture notes in Operation Research and Management Science with Python.

Welcome to a short introductory material on Operation Research and Management Science using Python.

Operations Research (a.k.a., Management Science) is an interdisciplinary field that uses analytical methods for quantitative decision-making. The emphasis of Operations Research is on practical applications, and as such, it has substantial overlap with many other disciplines, like industrial engineering and business management. It uses tools from mathematical sciences, such as modeling, probability, statistics, and optimization, to arrive at optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex decision-making problems. Operations Research is often concerned with determining the best answers to real-world objectives, such as maximizing profit or minimizing cost.
