# Notes on OR and MS with Python

[Operations Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research) (a.k.a., [Management Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_science)) is an interdisciplinary field that uses analytical methods for quantitative decision-making. The emphasis of Operations Research is on practical applications, and as such, it has substantial overlap with many other disciplines, like industrial engineering and business management. It uses tools from mathematical sciences, such as modeling, probability, statistics, and optimization, to arrive at optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex decision-making problems. Operations Research is often concerned with determining the best answers to real-world objectives, such as maximizing profit or minimizing cost.

For reference material on the topic, I strongly recommend reading:
* [Introduction to Management Science, 13th Edition, by Bernard Taylor, ISBN-13: 978-0134730660](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Management-Science-Whats-Operations/dp/0134730666) (the main source of the content written here)
* [Optimization in Operation Research, 2nd Edition, by Ronald Rardin, ISBN-13: 978-0134384559](https://www.amazon.com/Optimization-Operations-Research-Ronald-Rardin/dp/0134384555/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1639675261&sr=1-1)
* [Data, Models, and Decisions: The Fundamentals of Management Science, by Dimitris Bertsimas, Robert Freund, ISBN-13: 978-0975914601](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Models-Decisions-Fundamentals-Management/dp/097591460X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Data%2C+Models%2C+and+Decisions%3A+The+Fundamentals+of+Management+Science%2C+by+Dimitris+Bertsimas%2C+Robert+Freund%2C+ISBN-13%3A+978-0975914601&qid=1639675286&s=books&sr=1-1)

Lastly, Ling-Chieh Kung, Associate Professor at the National Taiwan University, created a set of three online Coursera courses on Operations Research. These are 100% recommended:
* [Operations Research (1): Models and Applications](https://www.coursera.org/learn/operations-research-modeling)
* [Operations Research (2): Optimization Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/learn/operations-research-algorithms)
* [Operations Research (3): Theory](https://www.coursera.org/learn/operations-research-theory)
